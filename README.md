##  Project Overview

This project involves analyzing a **Music Store** database using SQL. The goal is to extract meaningful business insights by writing queries across three levels of difficulty â€“ Easy, Moderate, and Advanced â€“ based on a relational database schema (as shown above).

The schema consists of tables like `Customer`, `Invoice`, `InvoiceLine`, `Track`, `Genre`, `Album`, `Artist`, `Employee`, and more, forming a well-connected normalized database suitable for real-world business use.
